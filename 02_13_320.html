/*  
An array is a special case of Object []
Objects: a dict linked with something else; keys (string) mapped to values (anything) {}
collection of values where each val has its own label
e.g., c = {"box": '"kpopbka", "tree": "aepebo"}
alert(c["box"]) this would give us kpopbka or alert(c.box)

b = [1, 7, 9, 700] array, alert(b[3]) would give us 700, is the same as...
b = {0:1, 1:7, 2:9, 3:700} alert(b[3])

b = [1, 7, 9, 700] //this is array
alert(b[3])
c = {0:1, 1:7, 2:9, 3:700} //this is object

d = {"box": "cat", "tree": "apple"}
