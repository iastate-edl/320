/*  
An array is a special case of Object []
Objects: a dict linked with something else; keys (string) mapped to values (anything) {}
e.g., c = {"box": '"kpopbka", "tree": "aepebo"}
alert(c["box"]) this would give us kpopbka or alert(c.box)

b = [1, 7, 9, 700] array, alert(b[3]) would give us 700, is the same as...
b = {0:1, 1:7, 2:9, 3:700} alert(b[3])
*/

b = [1, 7, 9, 700]
alert(b[3])
c = {0:1, 1:7, 2:9, 3:700}
alert(c[3])
